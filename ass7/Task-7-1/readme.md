# Consumed Endurance
> We interpret Consumed Endurance as the percentage of the energyt used or as the amount of fatigue.

### Endurance Metrics Explaination
**Strength**: The ratio between the average torque applied in the interaction and the maximum torque.   
**Endurance**: The time, in seconds, the participant could sustain such interaction before needing to rest the arm.   
**Consumed Endurance**: The ratio of the interaction time and the computerd endurance time.   

### GUI Usage
* adjust three sliders to control joint angles, get real-time limb modelling
* "anthropometrics table" button: show such a table from GitHub link
* "male/female" toggle: change associated anthropometrics based on gender
* graphical illustration in the left shows human upper limb, and the counterpart in the right shows limb modelling for consumed endurance
