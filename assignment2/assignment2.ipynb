Then the entropy of the random variable $X$ that ranges over horses gives us a lower bound on the number of bits: $H(X) = -\\sum^8_{i=1}P(i)\\log_2\\left(P(i)\\right)=2$ bits. Such a code can be built by using shorter encoding for more probable horses and longer encodings for less probable horses (for example, the most likely horse can be encoded as 0 while the least likely horse can be coded as 111111. If the horses have equal probability then if we repeat the above calculation we will find that the entropy would be 3.\n",

    "The basic way of training a language model is by counting instances of $n$-grams in corpora (frequency estimation). These counts have to be normalised in order to create a probabilistic model. Fundamentally, one takes the count of say a particular bigram and divide it by the sum of all the bigrams that share the first word (which is identical to the unigram count of the first word). This is a form of _parameter estimation_. In general, we estimate an $n$-gram probability by dividing the observed frequency of a particular sequence by the observed frequency of a prefix. Using such relative frequency to estimate probabilities is an example of maximum likelihood estimation (the likelihood of the training set given the model is maximised). Typically language models use log-probs.\n",
